# Cratonomics

## Player Unknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) Crate Expected Values

Python 3 program to download pricing data from the Steam [market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/) and calculate the [Expected Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of opening a [PUBG](http://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/) crate compared to selling the crate on the Steam market.

For some crates, the containing item probability is published: [Biker / Desperado](https://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/1576688908203724690),  [Raider / Triumph](https://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/1653258341515442673), [Militia / Fever](https://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/2742000471562664977), [Equinox](https://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/3229520292629848297) and [Aviator](https://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/1648759816031158998).  For other crates (Survivor / Wanderer), data was found online from a secondary [source](https://www.pubg-stats.net/depot/crates).  These probabilities could be innacurate.

Downloading pricing data from the Steam market is throttled to 1 request every 3 seconds.  Thus, the initial run time of the program is > 5 minutes.

This program saves the data into a locally running [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center) server.  mongod needs to be running before running the script.
